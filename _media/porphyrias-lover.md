>The rain set early in to-night,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sullen wind was soon awake,  
It tore the elm-tops down for spite,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And did its worst to vex the lake:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I listened with heart fit to break.  
When glided in Porphyria; straight  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She shut the cold out and the storm,  
And kneeled and made the cheerless grate  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blaze up, and all the cottage warm;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which done, she rose, and from her form  
Withdrew the dripping cloak and shawl,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And laid her soiled gloves by, untied  
Her hat and let the damp hair fall,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, last, she sat down by my side  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And called me. When no voice replied,  
She put my arm about her waist,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And made her smooth white shoulder bare,  
And all her yellow hair displaced,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, stooping, made my cheek lie there,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And spread, o'er all, her yellow hair,  
Murmuring how she loved me â€” she  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too weak, for all her heart's endeavour,  
To set its struggling passion free  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From pride, and vainer ties dissever,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And give herself to me for ever.  
But passion sometimes would prevail,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor could to-night's gay feast restrain  
A sudden thought of one so pale  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For love of her, and all in vain:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, she was come through wind and rain.  
Be sure I looked up at her eyes  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Happy and proud; at last I knew  
Porphyria worshipped me; surprise  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made my heart swell, and still it grew  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I debated what to do.  
That moment she was mine, mine, fair,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perfectly pure and good: I found  
A thing to do, and all her hair  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one long yellow string I wound  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three times her little throat around,  
And strangled her. No pain felt she;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am quite sure she felt no pain.  
As a shut bud that holds a bee,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I warily oped her lids: again  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughed the blue eyes without a stain.  
And I untightened next the tress  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About her neck; her cheek once more  
Blushed bright beneath my burning kiss:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propped her head up as before,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only, this time my shoulder bore  
Her head, which droops upon it still:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smiling rosy little head,  
So glad it has its utmost will,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That all it scorned at once is fled,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I, its love, am gained instead!  
Porphyria's love: she guessed not how  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her darling one wish would be heard.  
And thus we sit together now,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all night long we have not stirred,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet God has not said a word!
