<!--start-->
We show that the phenomenon of anomalous weak values is not limited to quantum theory. In particular, we show that the same features occur in a simple model of a coin subject to a form of classical backaction with pre- and postselection. This provides evidence that weak values are not inherently quantum but rather a purely statistical feature of pre- and postselection with disturbance.
