The broad thesis is that the current quagmire involving Israel, Palestine, and the Arab worls is an offshoot of long-standing European anti-Semitism that's endured from the 19th century to today.   

- Jewish populations underwent centuries of repression and racially and religiously motivated violence in Europe, with many migrating to America and to the Arab world. Still, the majority remained and formed tightly-knit communities.  
- Jews remained politically passive until Jewish communities started adopting notions of etho-nationalism that were burgeoning throughout Europe. Theodor Herzi called for the creation of a Jewish state, or "Judenstaat", something unacceptable to other competing etho-nationalist movement.   
- Intoleratnce for a Jewish nation prompted calls for a Jewish state outside Europe. This was a controversial view, as some Jews feared talks of nationhood would prompt violence against them.  
- This took place in the background of imperialism. Nations carved out parts of the world as their own, and as such, felt that a solution to the problem of an increasingly restive Jewish population could be to have them emigrate to a colonial destination.  
- Imperialism also vacated notions on indigenous peoples having claims to rights or humanity. Arab lands were for all practical purposes empty, despite the existing Palestinian population.
