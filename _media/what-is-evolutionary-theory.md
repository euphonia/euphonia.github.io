This lecture provides a good background into the basics of evolutionary theory. More interestingly, he focuses on its historical roots. The notion of 'survival of the fittest' was strongly built into the culture of the late 1800's and decades prior, a la Horatio Alger's *Lucky Dick*. Evolutionary theory, as Darwin put forward, was an observation of a cultural phenomenon in nature, repackaged as scientific theory, and the reinserted into public discourse as the proper way of doing things. The whole "the strong live and weak die" type of narrative continues to exist today.  

By no means does that devalue Darwin's contributions. Rather, it may very well be a case of people trying to back up a philosophical idea and then latching on to an example of its implementation in nature, claiming it as validation of the idea.
