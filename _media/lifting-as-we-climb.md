<!--start-->
This is an analysis published in 2010 regarding wealth gaps among racial groups in the United States. While women, in terms of net wealth, universaly lagged behind men, the study showed that there are abolutely immense wealth gaps between black/hispanic women and white women.

Interesting bits from the report:  
1. "Single black and Hispanic women have a median wealth of $100 and $120 respectively; the median for single white women is $41,500."  

It's been a while since I've read it. I'll add more later. I'm really just filling out this page with papers I want to remember.
