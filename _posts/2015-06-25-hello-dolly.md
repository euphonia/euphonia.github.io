		The rain set early in to-night, <br> 
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sullen wind was soon awake,  <br>
		It tore the elm-tops down for spite,  <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And did its worst to vex the lake:  <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I listened with heart fit to break.  <br>
		When glided in Porphyria; straight  <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She shut the cold out and the storm,  <br>
		And kneeled and made the cheerless grate  <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blaze up, and all the cottage warm;  <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which done, she rose, and from her form  <br>
		Withdrew the dripping cloak and shawl,  <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And laid her soiled gloves by, untied  <br>
		Her hat and let the damp hair fall,  <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, last, she sat down by my side  <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And called me. When no voice replied,  <br>
		She put my arm about her waist,  <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And made her smooth white shoulder bare,  <br>
		And all her yellow hair displaced,  <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, stooping, made my cheek lie there,  <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And spread, o'er all, her yellow hair,  <br>
		Murmuring how she loved me â€” she  <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too weak, for all her heart's endeavour,  <br>
		To set its struggling passion free  <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From pride, and vainer ties dissever,  <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And give herself to me for ever.  <br>
		But passion sometimes would prevail,  <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor could to-night's gay feast restrain  <br>
		A sudden thought of one so pale  <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For love of her, and all in vain:  <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, she was come through wind and rain.  <br>
		Be sure I looked up at her eyes  <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Happy and proud; at last I knew  <br>
		Porphyria worshipped me; surprise  <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made my heart swell, and still it grew  <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I debated what to do.  <br>
		That moment she was mine, mine, fair,  <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perfectly pure and good: I found  <br>
		A thing to do, and all her hair  <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one long yellow string I wound  <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three times her little throat around,  <br>
		And strangled her. No pain felt she;  <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am quite sure she felt no pain.  <br>
		As a shut bud that holds a bee,  <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I warily oped her lids: again  <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughed the blue eyes without a stain.  <br>
		And I untightened next the tress  <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About her neck; her cheek once more  <br>
		Blushed bright beneath my burning kiss:  <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propped her head up as before,  <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only, this time my shoulder bore  <br>
		Her head, which droops upon it still:  <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smiling rosy little head,  <br>
		So glad it has its utmost will,  <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That all it scorned at once is fled,  <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I, its love, am gained instead!  <br>
		Porphyria's love: she guessed not how  <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her darling one wish would be heard.  <br>
		And thus we sit together now,  <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all night long we have not stirred,  <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet God has not said a word!  <br>
